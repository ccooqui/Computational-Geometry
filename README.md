# Computational-Geometry
Projects that focus on computational geometry concepts

## Featuring
In this repository it features projects from a course that focused on concepts related to comutational geometry.

## Project 0
Lets the user create points when clicking on the screen and connects them together. If the angle between 3 points in counter clockwise or clockwise the colors will be red and green respectively.

## Project 1
Checks for line segment intersections and displays point of intersection if they do.

## Project 2
Lets the user create points when clicking on screen and connects them together with an edge. It will display any true diagonals, all potential diagonals, if the polygon is clockwise or counter clock wise, if the boundary is closed, and if it is simple.

## Project 3 
Demonstrates the gift wrap algorithm by creating a polgyon given a randomly generated set of points.

## Final Project
Demonstrates algorithm for Advance rules and finding the intersection of two polygons.
